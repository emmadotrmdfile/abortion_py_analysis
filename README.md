# Abortion Policy and Economic Outcomes

This repository contains a Python project analyzing the socioeconomic consequences of abortion restrictions in the United States following the 2022 annulment of reproductive rights. The project examines how differences in state-level abortion policies impact women's workforce participation and state-level economic performance.

## Research Question

How does abortion access affect women's labor force participation and state economic outcomes?

## Data and Methods

- **Data:** State-level measures of abortion policy restrictiveness, female labor force participation, and economic indicators (e.g., GDP)  
- **Analysis:** Python-based best fit exponential models to estimate the effects of policy restrictiveness on workforce participation and economic outcomes  

## Key Findings

- Increasing abortion restrictions are associated with modest economic costs, reflected in both workforce participation and GDP  
- About **10.5%** of the variation in labor force loss across states is explained by the restrictiveness of abortion laws  
- About **10.4%** of the variation in GDP loss across states is explained by policy restrictiveness  
- These results translate into substantial numbers of affected women and millions of dollars in lost productivity
